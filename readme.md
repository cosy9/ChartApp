# What's this app about ?

This is a basic Chart App where user can see list of stocks
and also their details. I've also added buy modal too.

# How to run the app ?

For running the app one need to have expo installed.
Once that is done install all the dependencies by typing
'npm install' and then type 'npm start'.
It will show option to start app in android, ios or web
,one can select any option as desired. I've developed this
app in android device.
